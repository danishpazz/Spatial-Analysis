This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


Spatial Data Analysis is a process of understanding spatial relationships and patterns from the locational data. 
*This notebook explains about the procedure for analyzing the factors that influence median house value by hedonic regression model.*

The given dataset *Glasgow* has an infromation of house charactersitics, neighbourhood characterstics at a census level. 

First step:
```{r}
tmp <- tempfile()
download.file("https://utdallas.box.com/s/fjirg28h5hx4dvfdecv3t3ytfy5arqht", destfile = tmp)
#Glasgowdf <- as.data.frame(https://utdallas.box.com/s/fjirg28h5hx4dvfdecv3t3ytfy5arqht)
install.packages("rgdal")
library(rgdal)
s1 <- readOGR(".", "GlasgowShape")
Glasgowdf <- as.data.frame(".", "GlasgowShape")
rownames(Glasgowdf) <- 1:nrow(Glasgowdf)
rownames(Glasgowdf)
```

Now, Out of all teh variables, we will select top 5 features that influence house prices. 

```{r}
install.packages("maptools")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("car")
```


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(car)
library(maptools)
library(rgdal)
getinfo.shape("C:/Stuff/Seagate_Backup/dinesh/education/UTD_Sem/UTD_Sem2/Adv_DA/Lab5/GlasgowWeb/Glasgowshape.shp")
Glasgow.shp <- readOGR("C:/Stuff/Seagate_Backup/dinesh/education/UTD_Sem/UTD_Sem2/Adv_DA/Lab5/GlasgowWeb/Glasgowshape.shp")
Glasgow.df <- as.data.frame(Glasgow.shp)
Glas.frame <- Glasgow.df[c("MEDPRICE","MEDROOM","CRIME","SALES","TYPE","INCOMEDEP")]
```

```{r}
scatterplotMatrix(Glas.frame, data=Glasgow.df)
```

```{r}
summary(Glas.frame)
```
