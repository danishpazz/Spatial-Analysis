## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Objective
The main purpose of this project is to identify and evaluate the factors that influence the median home value at census tract level. Segmenting it, the following are the expected outcomes of the project:  
a. Identification of the variables at census track level and at site level that influence house prices.  
b. Analyze the spatial patterns of the neighborhood characteristics such as Demographics, school quality, travel time to work and so on.  
c. Build a hedonic pricing model and calculate the coefficients that determines the buyerâ€™s willingness to pay for additional characteristics.

## Preliminary Analysis
In general when we think about the factors that influence house prices at Censes Track level, the first thing comes to the mind are *Per capita income, Median Number of rooms and vacancy rates at  neighbourhood effects. From the literature review, many other variables such as Median House Price, Floor Space, Age | School District | Distance to CBD , No of Job Opening per person | Distance to Major Road* were also disccussed. 

Table Header      
-----------,-----------,-----------,-----------,-----------,  
Median House Price, Floor Space, Age | School District | Distance to CBD 
No of Job Opening per person | Distance to Major Road 


```{r}
smoke <- matrix(c("Median_House_Price", 'Floor_Space, Age' , 'School_District' , 'Distance2CBD', 'No_of_JobOpening_perperson' , 'Distance2MajorRoad'), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)

```

So, after carefull examination the following variables are considered for the preliminary analysis. *Population growth, Median House Age, Percapita Income, Population growth rate, School District, Distance to CBT, Vacancy rate, Median no of Rooms, House price Index*. 

## Study Area

To build a good accurate model, the sample population should have good variance that can reflect variance of the full population. So all three counties Dallas, Collin, Denton are analyzed with respect to the Median House age, Per capita income and popualtion growth patterns.   

### Reasons behind selecting the variables are 

Median House Age: As most of the north american cities are designed as monocentirc models, the residential houses near to the Central buisness district were built earlier than others on the suburbs. The following image illustrates the spatial pattern of it.

Per Capita Income:

                       "Number of bins:",
                       min = 1,
                       max = 50,
                       value = 30)
        ),
        
        # Show a plot of the generated distribution
        mainPanel(
           plotOutput("distPlot")
        )
     )
  ),
   


     
  
  
  # Define server logic required to draw a histogram
  server <- function(input, output) {
     
     output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
        # generate bins based on input$bins from ui.R
        x    <- faithful[, 2] 
        bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)
        
        # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins
        hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')
     })
  }
