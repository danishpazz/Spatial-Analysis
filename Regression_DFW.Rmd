## Objective
The main purpose of this project is to identify and evaluate the factors that influence the median home value at census tract level. Segmenting it, the following are the expected outcomes of the project:  
a. Identification of the variables that influence house prices at census track level and at site level.  
b. Analyze the spatial patterns of the neighborhood characteristics such as Demographics, school quality, travel time to work and so on.  
c. Build a hedonic pricing model and calculate the coefficients that determines the buyerâ€™s willingness to pay for additional characteristics.


## Preliminary Analysis

In general when we think about the factors that influence house prices at Census Track level, the first thing comes to the mind are *Per capita income, Year Build and vacancy rates at  neighbourhood effects. In many prominent academic literatures, many other variables such as Median House Price, Floor Space, Median Age of pOpulation, School District, Distance to CBD , No of Job Opening per person, Distance to Major Road* were discussed. 

### Study Area

Obviously, City of Dallas/ Dallas County is the preferred location considering the Knowledge about local market Areas. As both City and Metroplex are huge in size, I opted to chose a portion of area. 

```{r}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>%
   setView(-96.800902, 32.780762, zoom = 10) %>% 
   addTiles() %>%
   addMarkers(-96.800902, 32.780762, popup = "Dallas") 
```


The points that are considered while choosing the study area are as follows: 

To build an accurate regression model, the sample population should have good variance that can reflect variance of the total population. So all three counties- Dallas, Collin, Denton are analyzed for spatial patterns with respect to the age of the houses and Per capita income levels.   

**Median House Age:** Spatial clustering of same age houses reflects the growth of any city. As most of the north american cities are designed as monochromatic models, the residential houses near to the Central business district were built earlier and due to the growth, new houses were built on teh pheriphery of the city boundaries. This phenomenon can be clearly observed in Dalals County. Most of the early built houses are with in the circular boundary of I635 and I20. 
The following image illustrates the spatial pattern of it.

**Per Capita Income:** Value of the house is highly correlated with the average income level. So, I analyzed the per capita income by census tract level and analyzed the spatial patterns. The following image illustrates it.

#The Final Study Area is yet to be finalized.

## Data Collection

 After careful examination of academic literatures and also by practicality, the following variables are considered for the preliminary analysis:

**List of variables with data availability** (Tentative)

* Median House Price by Census Tract 

* Job Proximity Index 

* School Proficiency Index 

* HPI by Census Track 

* Median Income by Census Tract  

* Median Population Age by Census Tract 

* Mean Travel Time to work by Census Tract 

* Number of People with Bachelor's degree or Higher 

* Home Owner Vacancy Rate or   

~~Rental Vacancy Rate~~

* Median Number of rooms 

* Median House Age 

* Distance from Central Business District (Yet to be calculated) 

* Employers: Location of all employers with employee count and NACIS code in the area (MSA). (Point Shape File) 

* Number of New Developments: With geolocation coordinates, type, subclass data (Point Shape File) 

~~Location Affordability Index~~

~~Additonal No of Jobs created(From 2014 to 2015)~~ 

* Land Use: Area cover is all three counties. Level of detail is Census Tract. Motto behind the data collection is that if we can calculate the area of open space/Vacant Land or percentage with respect to the Build Area such as Residential/ Single Detached.
