## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Objective
The main purpose of this project is to identify and evaluate the factors that influence the median home value at census tract level. Segmenting it, the following are the expected outcomes of the project:  
a. Identification of the variables at census track level and at site level that influence house prices.  
b. Analyze the spatial patterns of the neighborhood characteristics such as Demographics, school quality, travel time to work and so on.
